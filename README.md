1) Setup: Import libraries (requests, BeautifulSoup), define the seed URL, and initialize tracking sets and an output file for scraped data.
2) URL Filtering: Use should_scrape_url to validate URLs based on domain, query parameters, and restricted categories or indices.
3) Scraping: Send HTTP GET requests, parse HTML with BeautifulSoup, extract text from <p> tags, and save it to a file.
4) Crawling: Recursively process links by checking if they are valid and unvisited, converting relative URLs to absolute ones.
5) Execution: Start with the seed URL and recursively scrape and save data, finalizing by closing the output file.
